# Cloudflare's API
Interact with Cloudflare's products and services via the Cloudflare API. New to Cloudflare? [Start here](/fundamentals/get-started).

Using the Cloudflare API requires authentication so that Cloudflare knows who is making requests and what permissions they have. [Create an API token](/api/get-started/create-token) to grant access to the API to perform actions. You can also authenticate with [API keys](/api/get-started/keys), though Cloudflare recommends transitioning to using API tokens.
